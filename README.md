## ✅ Fixed: Download & Package List from URL

The **Package Downloader** has been fixed. It now correctly fetches the package list from a URL (via `store.rg-adguard.net`) and downloads Appx/MSIX files, no longer being blocked or returning empty results.

## 💻 prerequisites

To run or build the application, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10 (Version 1809, Build 17763 or later) or Windows 11.
- **Architecture**: x64 or ARM64.
- **Developer Mode**: Recommended for installing unsigned packages (Settings -> Update & Security -> For developers).

## 🛠️ Building the Project

This project is built using **.NET 8 (Desktop)**. Follow these steps to set up your environment and compile the application.

### 1. Developer Environment
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)
- **Workload required**: ".NET Desktop Development"
- **Individual Component**: "Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)" or later.

### 2. Clone & Restore
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jdros15/AppxBundle-Installer.git
cd "AppxBundle Installer"

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Development Build
For quick testing and debugging:
```powershell
dotnet run --project AppxBundleInstaller
```

### 4. 🚀 Optimized Production Build (Important)
To create a standalone executable that is **optimized for size** (avoiding the 250MB+ bloat of standard self-contained builds), use the following command. 

This command enables **Single File** publishing and **Compression**, which drastically reduces the final `.exe` size (typically ~60-80MB for a fully self-contained app).

# Publish optimized standalone executable
dotnet publish AppxBundleInstaller/AppxBundleInstaller.csproj `
    -c Release `
    -r win-x64 `
    --self-contained true `
    -p:PublishSingleFile=true `
    -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true `
    -p:DebugType=embedded `
    -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true

**Output Location**:  
`AppxBundleInstaller/bin/Release/net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win-x64/publish/`

> **Note**: The resulting `.exe` includes the .NET Runtime, so users **do not** need to install .NET manually.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Errors

| Error Code | Helper Text | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `0x800B0100` | No Signature | Enable **Developer Mode** in Windows Settings or sign the package with a trusted certificate. |
| `0x80073CF3` | Dependency Error | The package depends on a framework (e.g., VCLibs) that is missing. Install dependencies first. |
| `0x80070005` | Access Denied | Run the installer as Administrator or check if Group Policies block sideloading. |
| `0x80073CFF` | License Issue | A valid license is required for this app or side-loading is disabled. |

### Diagnostics
If the application behaves unexpectedly, navigate to the **Logs** (or Diagnostics) tab. You can export the logs to a text file for analysis.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The solution follows a standard MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern tailored for WPF:

- **`Views/`**: XAML UI definitions (MainWindow, InstallView, SettingsView).
- **`ViewModels/`**: Logic bindings (InstallViewModel, AppListViewModel).
- **`Services/`**: Core logic (PackageManager, Elevation, Logging).
  - `PackageManagerService.cs`: Wraps functionality around `Windows.Management.Deployment`.
  - `PackageValidationService.cs`: Validates file headers and manifests.
- **`Models/`**: Data structures (PackageInfo, LogEntry).
